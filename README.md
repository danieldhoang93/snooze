# Snooze (snooze)

This alarm clock app will let you donate to a list of charities when you snooze your alarms. It is just a prototype for now, but the goal is to get a list of charities, their information, and the ability to donate to them by using the Global Giving API.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
